# Creating a New Telegram Bot Using BotFather

To create a new bot on Telegram, you'll need to use BotFather, Telegram's official bot for creating and managing bots.

## Steps to Create a New Bot

1. Start a Chat with BotFather:
   - Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
   - Start a chat with BotFather by clicking on the "Start" button.

2. Create a New Bot:
   - Send the /newbot command to BotFather.
   - BotFather will ask you to provide a name for your bot. Choose a name (e.g., MyAwesomeBot).
   - Next, BotFather will ask you to choose a username for your bot. This username must end in bot (e.g., MyAwesomeBot_bot).

3. Get Your Bot Token:
   - After successfully creating the bot, BotFather will provide you with an authentication token.
   - This token is essential for authenticating your bot when making API requests to Telegram's Bot API.

4. Keep Your Token Secure:
   - Store your bot token securely. Do not share it with anyone else, as it provides complete access to your bot.

5. Using the Bot Token:
   - Replace <YOUR_BOT_TOKEN> in API requests with the token provided by BotFather.

6. Further Configuration:
   - Optionally, you can configure additional settings for your bot using BotFather, such as adding a description, profile picture, or enabling inline mode.

7. BotFather Commands:
   - BotFather offers additional commands to manage your bot. You can explore these commands by typing /help in the BotFather chat.

## Example API Request with cURL

Here's an example of how to use cURL to retrieve basic information about your bot:

```
